        time: February 2022 - June 2022
        company: Vanilla Internet - Cape Town CBD.
        details: |
          Was taken on at [vanilla internet service provider](https://www.vanilla.co.za/ "Vanilla internet"){:target="_blank"} as roll of Senior Network Engineer when permanent, during the probation period I primary looked over whole network, with the idea of admin, learnt the whole network infrastructure, and did support on ubnt/ubiquity devices and controllers at clients. Due to shortage of ubnt/ubiquity hardware was decided on tplink and I setup and tested tplink wireless devices and [controllers]( https://www.tp-link.com/za/business-networking/management-platform/omada-cloud-based-controller/ "Omada network controller"){:target="_blank"} for network wide rollout, and documented it. This is all devices over the wan network being setup and run from a controller, with all the needed configs to make the work of the installers as simple as possible, this was done. The technology or framework to do all this is called tplinks omada EAP series centralized management.<br><br>
